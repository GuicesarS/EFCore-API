# üé¨ Fusca Filmes API

This repository contains an API developed with **.NET 8** using **Entity Framework Core** and **Minimal APIs**, structured with a layered architecture.  
This project was created as a study base, with the goal of understanding how to structure a RESTful API, work with relational databases, manage entity relationships, and apply development best practices in a real-world context.

## üéØ Project Purpose

Although this is a study project, it was designed to simulate a real application, with useful features that can easily be adapted to other scenarios.

Through this project, you can:

- Practice and understand the usage of **Entity Framework Core** in real scenarios  
- Explore how to build **RESTful APIs with .NET**  
- Implement queries, filters, and relationships between entities  
- Learn about **layered project organization**
